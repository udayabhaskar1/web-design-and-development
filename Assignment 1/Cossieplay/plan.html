<h3>Goals:</h3>
<p>The Cossie Play website is intended to increase the revenue for Cossie Play by promoting the services offered by the company.It intends to see an increase in the number of people attending the parties every month and also the number of costumes ordered every week.</p>
<h3>Success Evaluation:</h3>
<p>Other advertising will be consistent for a period of 3 months (except for including the new web site), so that any increase in sales should be attributable to the site. At the end of this 3 month period (and during), the number of orders for the constumes  will be counted and compared to the previous 3 months.</p>
<h3>Target Audience:</h3>
<p>High school kids and young adults form the majority of our current audience,and this is who the site is aimed at.The site must be specifically designed by using imagery and colorful fonts to make it visually appealing for the younger age groups.</p>
